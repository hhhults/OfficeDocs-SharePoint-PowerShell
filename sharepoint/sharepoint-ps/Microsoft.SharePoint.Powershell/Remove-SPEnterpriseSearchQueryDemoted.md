## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Specifies the demoted site rule to delete.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid URL, in the form https://server_name; or an instance of a valid Demoted object.

```yaml
Type: DemotedPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Owner

> Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Specifies the search object owner that defines the scope at which the corresponding Demoted object is created. The owner must be one of the following valid levels:- Search Service Application- Site Subscription

```yaml
Type: SearchObjectOwner
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: o

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection

> Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

### -SearchApplication

> Applicable: SharePoint Server 2010, SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019

Specifies the search application that contains the demoted site collection.

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid search application name (for example, SearchApp1); or an instance of a valid SearchServiceApplication object.
