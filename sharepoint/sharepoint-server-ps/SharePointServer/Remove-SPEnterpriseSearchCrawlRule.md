## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE
```powershell
$searchApp = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication mySearchServiceApp
Remove-SPEnterpriseSearchCrawlRule -Identity https://mySPSite -SearchApplication $searchApp
```

This example removes a crawl rule pertaining to the path https://mySPSite from the mySearchServiceApp search service application.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

The crawl rule to delete.

A valid crawl rule URL, such as https://server_name, or an instance of a valid CrawlRule object.

```yaml
Type: CrawlRulePipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection

> Applicable: SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal. Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management. Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory. When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store. If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
