## DESCRIPTION
The Get-SPDesignerSettings cmdlet determines whether SharePoint Designer features are enabled on the specified Web application.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE
```powershell
Get-SPDesignerSettings -webapplication https://contoso
```

This example retrieves the SharePoint Designer settings for the Web application, https://contoso.

## PARAMETERS

### -WebApplication

> Applicable: SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

Specifies the Web application in which the settings apply.

```yaml
Type: SPWebApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection

> Applicable: SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
